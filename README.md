2. Use the friend system
    1. The token system:
        If you want to keep your friends list on various computers, you need a token. This like a password and your account (twitch or discord) act as an identifier
        The first time you use it, you'll be asked asked to choose a token, so remember it if you want to retrieve your friends list by changing browser/computer.
    2. How to use friends system:
        You can add friend when they have the overlay. To to that you just need to go on the user profile in the room players list
        ![user profile](images/profile.png)        
        After that everything is accessible via this button

**This overlay is more social-oriented than the others, so if you want it to be useful, recommend it to your friends !**
