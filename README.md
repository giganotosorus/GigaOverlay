2. Use the friend system
    - The token system:

        If you want to keep your friends list on various computers, you need a token. This like a password and your account (twitch or discord) act as an identifier
        The first time you use it, you'll be asked asked to choose a token, so remember it if you want to retrieve your friends list by changing browser/computer.

    - How to use friends system:

        You can add friend when they have the overlay. To to that you just need to go on the user profile in the room players list<br/>
