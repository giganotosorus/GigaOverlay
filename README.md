# GigaOverlay - JKLM.FUN

#### Setup the script in your browser
1. Download the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) extension
2. Add a new script, paste the content of `script.js` and save

### How to use the overlay
1. You have a settings button here
<img src=".images/settingsButton.png" alt="settings button">

2. Use the friend system
    - The token system:

        If you want to keep your friends list on various computers, you need a token. This like a password and your account (twitch or discord) act as an identifier
        The first time you use it, you'll be asked asked to choose a token, so remember it if you want to retrieve your friends list by changing browser/computer.

    - How to use friends system:

        You can add friend when they have the overlay. To to that you just need to go on the user profile in the room players list
        <img src="./images/profile.png" alt="user profile">
        After that everything is accessible via this button
        <img src="./images/friendListPane.png" alt="friend list pane">


**This overlay is more social-oriented than the others, so if you want it to be useful, recommend it to your friends !**
